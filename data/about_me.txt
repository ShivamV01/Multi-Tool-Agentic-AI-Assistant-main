My name is Shivam Vishwakarma, and I am a Data Scientist and AI Engineering enthusiast with a strong academic foundation and a deep passion for solving real-world problems through data-driven solutions.

I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Engineering (Electrical) and have developed a strong interest in Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and advanced analytics. My engineering background has strengthened my logical reasoning and problem-solving skills, which I actively apply while working with data, machine learning models, and AI-driven systems.

I have worked on several impactful projects, including:

Web-based Interactive AI Agents

Fraud Detection using Machine Learning algorithms

Recommendation Systems based on user behavior

Hotel Booking Analysis using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Tableau

Sky Analytics using Excel dashboards

Healthcare Data Analysis using a dynamic Power BI dashboard

These projects allowed me to combine analytical thinking with hands-on implementation using tools such as Python, SQL, Power BI, Tableau, and Machine Learning frameworks.

In addition, I have experience building intelligent, user-centric applications, including interactive AI systems that allow users to ask questions and receive real-time responses. This work enhanced my understanding of end-to-end AI pipelines, deployment concepts, and practical problem-solving.

Beyond technology, I am deeply interested in technology trends and continuous learning, which helps me stay updated with evolving tools and methodologies in data science and AI.

I am eager to continue learning, contribute to meaningful and innovative projects, and grow professionally in the fields of Data Science, Analytics, and Artificial Intelligence.
